                    I am a young web site designer 
                    learning everything and anything in the field of computer science.
                    I believe that computers are our future, so I am taking advantage
                    of the opportunities that are handed to me. I am currently a

                    named, "The App Academy." Here, I am learning Web site, Mobile, and
